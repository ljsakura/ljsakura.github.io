The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+----+-------+--------+-----------+ 
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId | 
+----+-------+--------+-----------+ 
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3        | 
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4        | 
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL     | 
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL     | 
+----+-------+--------+-----------+ 

Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

+----------+ 
| Employee | 
+----------+ 
| Joe      | 
+----------+ 
```

通过员工编号匹配员工对应的老板，并返回比其老板工资高的员工，只想问，老板，你真的想造吗？
```sql
select 
    a.Name as Employee 
from Employee as a
left join Employee as b on
    a.ManagerId= b.Id
where a.Salary >b.Salary
