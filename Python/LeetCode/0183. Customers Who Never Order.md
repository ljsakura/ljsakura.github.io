Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+ 
| Id | Name  | 
+----+-------+ 
| 1  | Joe   | 
| 2  | Henry | 
| 3  | Sam   | 
| 4  | Max   | 
+----+-------+ 

Table: Orders.

+----+------------+ 
| Id | CustomerId | 
+----+------------+ 
| 1  | 3          | 
| 2  | 1          | 
+----+------------+

Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+ 
| Customers | 
+-----------+ 
| Henry     | 
| Max       | 
+-----------+ 
```

查找未下单的用户并返回其姓名
```sql
--Solution 1
select 
    Name as Customers 
from Customers
left join Orders on
    Customers.Id = Orders.CustomerId
where CustomerId is null

--Solution 2
select 
    Name as Customers 
from Customers
where Id not in 
(
    select CustomerId from Orders
)
```
