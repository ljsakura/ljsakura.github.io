Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```
Note:

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

数组旋转，并降低空间维度，为避免返回空，要对nums进行修正

```python
class Solution(object):
    def rotate(self, nums, k):
        """
        :typenums: List[int]
        :typek: int
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
       """
        n = len(nums)
        k = k % n # 当 k 大于 n 时，可以不用多次无效循环
        nums[:] = nums[n-k:]+nums[:n-k] #为防止返回空，这里应用nums[:]，而非nums
