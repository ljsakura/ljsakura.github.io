Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]. 

Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

[show hint]

Hint:  
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

数组旋转，并降低空间维度，为避免返回空，要对nums进行修正

```python
class Solution(object):
    def rotate(self, nums, k):
        """
        :typenums: List[int]
        :typek: int
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
       """
        n = len(nums)
        k = k % n # 当 k 大于 n 时，可以不用多次无效循环
        nums[:] = nums[n-k:]+nums[:n-k] #为防止返回空，这里应用nums[:]，而非nums
