Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.   
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.   
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.  
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:

Input: "III"  
Output: 3  
Example 2:

Input: "IV"  
Output: 4  
Example 3:

Input: "IX"  
Output: 9  
Example 4:

Input: "LVIII"  
Output: 58  
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.  
Example 5:

Input: "MCMXCIV"  
Output: 1994  
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.  
罗马数字转换为数值  
首先查找罗马字符代表的数字并创建dictionary，同时要注意，罗马字符中的减法表示为前一个字符代表的数字如果比后一个字符代表的数字小，则前一个字符应该做减法，如DM表示为M-D

为确定某个字符是否该做减法，则做了一个缓冲值last 用来存储上一个数值，并将last首先赋值为s[0]在dictionary中代表的数字

```python
class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        """
        :types: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        roman_dic ={
            "I" : 1,
            "V": 5,
            "X" : 10,
            "L" : 50,
            "C" : 100,
            "D" : 500,
            "M" : 1000
        }
        total = 0
        last = roman_dic[s[0]]
        for i in s:
            if last< roman_dic[i]:
                total -= 2*last 
                # 当检测到减法运算时，对该数值进行2倍减法，同时在正常运算中继续加入该数值，则实际上只做了一次减法
            total += roman_dic[i]
            last = roman_dic[i]

        return total
```
