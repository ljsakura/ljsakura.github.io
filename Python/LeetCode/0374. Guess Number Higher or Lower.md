We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
 ```
Example :
```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```
从1到 n 中任取一个数字，猜测究竟取的是哪个数字，有一个内置函数 guess(int num) 会根据猜测值返回三种结果  
依旧是一道二分法的题目，通过二分法调整左右边界，最后得到结果
```python
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):

class Solution(object):
    def guessNumber(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        left , right = 1 , n
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right)/2
            if guess(mid) == -1:
                right = mid - 1
            elif guess(mid) == 1:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                return mid
        return left ### 返回 left 要比返回 right 性能忧
```
