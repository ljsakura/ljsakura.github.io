Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
```
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```
Example 2:
```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```
Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:
```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```
顺序排列的 array，去除重复超过两次的数字，最后返回新的长度，要求使用额外空间  
遍历，发现有超过两次的重复值就抛到 array 最后，然后返回所需长度即可
```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums:
            return 0
        l = len(nums)-1
        result = 0
        cnt = 1
        i = 1
        while i < len(nums) and l > 0:
            if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
                result += cnt
                cnt = 1
                i += 1
            elif nums[i] == nums[i-1] and cnt < 2:
                cnt += 1
                i += 1
            elif nums[i] == nums[i-1] and cnt == 2:
                nums[:] = nums[:i] + nums[i+1:] + [nums[i]]
            l -= 1
        result += cnt
        return result
```
