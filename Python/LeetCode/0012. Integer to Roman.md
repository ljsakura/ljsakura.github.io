Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: ```I, V, X, L, C, D``` and ```M```.
```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```
For example, two is written as ```II``` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, ```XII```, which is simply ```X + II```. The number twenty seven is written as ```XXVII```, which is ```XX + V + II```.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not ```IIII```. Instead, the number four is written as ```IV```. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as ```IX```. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
```
I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
```
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:
```
Input: 3
Output: "III"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 4
Output: "IV"
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 9
Output: "IX"
```
Example 4:
```
Input: 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```
Example 5:
```
Input: 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```
给定一组数字对应的罗马字母，将数值转化为罗马字母  
其中连续字符不能多于三个，如4要表示为1|5，9表示为1|10  
基本思路就是除10取余数，如是4就表示为1|5，如是9则表示为1|10，同时设定指针，按两位一组进行遍历，如1和5是一组，可以表示除9以外的所有数值，10和50是一组，表示除90以外所有数值，以此类推  
以上做法对超过1000（或是超过了value array 长度）的操作均无效，超过1000的直接返回1000的倍数乘以"M"即可
```python
class Solution(object):
    def intToRoman(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        symbol = ["I","V","X","L","C","D","M"]
        value = [1,5,10,50,100,500,1000]
        result = ""
        i = 0
        while num and i < len(value):
            if num % 10 == 4 and i + 1 < len(value): ### 如是4且 i+1 存在的话则表示为1|5
                result = symbol[i] + symbol[i+1] + result
            elif num % 10 == 9 and i + 2 < len(value): ### 如是9且 i+2 存在的话则表示为1|10
                result = symbol[i] + symbol[i+2] + result
            elif num % 10 > 4 and i + 1 < len(value):
                result = symbol[i+1] + symbol[i]*(num % 10-5) + result
            elif num % 10 <= 3:
                result =symbol[i]*(num % 10) + result
            else:
                result = symbol[i]*(num % 10) + result ### 超过1000的数值归为此条
            num /= 10
            i += 2 ### value array 中两位为一组可以表示除9*（10的 n 次方）以外的所有数值
        return result
```
