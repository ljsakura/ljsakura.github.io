Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example 1:
```
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
```
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:
```
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
```
Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:
```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```
给定指定数值val，删除list 中的val， 并返回新的list的长度  
与26题相似，这里考虑的同样是遍历list ，定义辅助参数length，当发现list中某个数值不等于val时，将该数值赋值给list[length-1]，同时将length的长度加1，这样就变相将所有不为val的数值都放在了最前，最终截取length长度的list为新list

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :typenums: List[int]
        :typeval: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums:
            return0
        if val not in nums:
            print nums  # 注意这里，如果用return，则会报错，显示TypeError: range() integer end argument expected, got list，但如果换做print则不再报错
        length = 0
        for i in range(0,len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != val:
                length += 1
                nums[length-1] = nums[i]
        nums = nums[:length]
        return length
```
