A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).

Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.
[8,4,2,1]
[32,16,8,4,2,1]

[0011]
[011001]
For example, the above binary watch reads "3:25".

Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.

Example:

Input: n = 1
Return: ["1:00", "2:00", "4:00", "8:00", "0:01", "0:02", "0:04", "0:08", "0:16", "0:32"]
Note:

The order of output does not matter.
The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, it should be "1:00".
The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".

二进制手表上面一行有四个灯，分别代表[8,4,2,1]，用来表示小时(0-11)，下面一行有六个灯，分别代表[32,16,8,4,2,1]，用来表示分钟(0-59)  
每一个灯都代表0或1，右端为低位  
给定一个非负整数，代表亮灯的个数，返回手表上所有可以表示的时间  
小时可以是一位或两位数字，但不能以0开头，分钟必须是两位数字，不足的要在左端补上0  
计算小时和分钟的二进制数值中1的个数，两者之和等于 num 的即是
```python
class Solution(object):
    def readBinaryWatch(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        h = 0
        m = 0 ### 设定初始值后效率提升
        result = []
        for h in range(12):
            for m in range(60):
                if bin(h).count("1") + bin(m).count("1") == num:
                    result.append("%d:%02d" %(h,m))
        return result
```
