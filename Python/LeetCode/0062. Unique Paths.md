A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```
Example 2:
```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```
机器人从 m*n 网格的左上角要移动到右下角，且每一步只能向右或向下，则到达右下角有多少种唯一走法  
动态规划问题，matrix[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j] + matrix[i][j-1]  
生成 m*n 的0矩阵，将第一行和第一列的值置为1，然后执行动态规划，最后返回右下角的值即可
```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        matrix = [[0]*n for x in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            matrix[i][0] = 1
        for j in range(n):
            matrix[0][j] = 1
        for i in range(1,m):
            for j in range(1,n):
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j] + matrix[i][j-1]
        return matrix[m-1][n-1]
```
