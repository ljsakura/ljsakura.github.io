Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

For example, given input 43261596 (represented in binary as 00000010100101000001111010011100), return 964176192 (represented in binary as 00111001011110000010100101000000).

给定一个integer，转化为32位的的bits，并反转序位求其对应的integer

```python
class Solution: 
    # @param n, an integer 
    # @return an integer 
     def reverseBits(self, n): 
        m = bin(n)[2:] 
        result , count = 0 , 31 
         while len(m): 
            result  += int(m[-1])*(2**count) 
            count -= 1 
            m = m[:-1] 
         return result
