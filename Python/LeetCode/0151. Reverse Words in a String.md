Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```
Example 4:
```
Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
Output: "Alice Loves Bob"
```
Example 5:
```
Input: s = "Alice does not even like bob"
Output: "bob like even not does Alice"
``` 

Constraints:
```
1 <= s.length <= 104
s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
There is at least one word in s.
```

Could you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?  

反转句子中的单词顺序，句子首位可能有空格，单词之间的空格可能多于一个
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        s = s.strip() ### strip 仅仅是返回一个 copy，所以这里要将去除首尾空格后的字符串重新赋值给原字段
        words = s.split() ### split 默认按空格将原字段切割开来，无论多少个空格连在一起，都按一个空格处理
        words.reverse() ### 反转单词顺序
        return " ".join(words) ### 重新拼接并在单词之间加入一个空格
```
