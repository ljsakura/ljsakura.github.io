Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.



```
For example, the following two linked lists: 

A:          a1 →a2         ↘                     
                                c1 →c2 →c3 
B:      b1 →b2 →b3         ↗              
 

begin to intersect at node c1.
```
Example 1:
```
A:          4 →1         ↘                     
                                8 →4 →5 
B:       5 →0 →1         ↗              
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

Example 2:
```
A:         0 →9 →1         ↘                     
                                2 →4 
B:               3         ↗              
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```
Example 3:
```
A:         2 →6 →4                           
                           
B:            1 →5             
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```
Notes:

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns. 
You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

参考了别人的solution，总结起来就是能够交叉的链表有如下特点：
在结尾处有交叉结点，L1 + L2 与L2 + L1在尾部是一致的，且长度也一致

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        """
        :typehead1, head1: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        la , lb , temp = headA , headB , False
        while la and lb:
            if la == lb:
                return la
            la , lb = la.next , lb.next
            if not la and not temp:
                la , temp = headB , True 
                # 这里和下两行一样，需要用headB 而不能用lb，即当链表A遍历结束后，指针跳转至链表B开端，实现了LA+LB
            if not lb:
                lb = headA # 当链表B遍历结束时，指针跳转至链表A开端，实现了LB+LA
                # 不管是让 la 跳转到了 B 表的开端，还是让 lb 跳转到 A 表开端，都是为了实现在 A 与 B 的长度不等的情况下，能够让交叉结点相遇
                # 设定了 temp 这个变量，也只是为了让两个指针只跳转一次，不会无限循环跳转
        return None
