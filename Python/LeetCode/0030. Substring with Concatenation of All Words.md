You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.


Example 1:
```
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
```
给定字符串 s 以及由相同长度字符串组成的 list words，返回 s 中是由 words 中所有字符串只出现一次所组成的子串  
比较笨的方法  

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findSubstring(self, s, words):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if len(words) == 0 or len(s) == 0:
            return []
        words.sort()
        lw = len(words)
        l = len(words[0])
        if len(s) < lw * l:
            return []
        result = []
        for i in xrange(len(s)-lw*l+1):
            temp = []
            for j in xrange(lw):
                if s[i+j*l:i+(j+1)*l] in words:
                    temp.append(s[i+j*l:i+(j+1)*l])
                else:
                    break
            if j == lw-1 and sorted(temp) == words:
                result.append(i)
        return result
```
