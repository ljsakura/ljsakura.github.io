There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

Note:

If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
Example 1:
```
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1

Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

给定一个围成圆环形的 N 个加油站，给定每个加油站可加油量以及从该加油站驶往下一个加油站所要消耗的油量，假定空箱出发，从哪个加油站出发可以绕加油站行驶一周  
所要表达的意思就是从第 i 个加油站出发，要保证每一站都有 sum(gas) >= sum(cost)  
遍历两个数组，累加 gas[i] - cost[i]，当出现累加值小于零时，则将起始位置跳转至 i+1，因为在 i 位置肯定 cost 极大，才使得原本为正的累加值变为负数，所以直接跳转到 i+1  
看到有人说要记录累积亏欠值，我觉得这个做法更为稳妥，以保证最后累积剩余油量可以不小于亏欠值
```python
class Solution(object):
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas, cost):
        """
        :type gas: List[int]
        :type cost: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
            return -1
        start , acc , lack = 0 , 0 , 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            acc += gas[i] - cost[i] ### 累计每一步剩余油量
            if acc < 0:
                start = i + 1 ### 如当前位置累计剩余油量为负，则将起始位置跳转至下一位
                lack += acc
                acc = 0
        if acc + lack >= 0: ### 确保剩余油量不小于亏欠值
            return start
```
