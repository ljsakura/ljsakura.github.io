You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Example:
```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version. 
```
如何寻找第一个出现的错品，假定当一个错品出现后，其后的产品均为错品  
题目中已给出一个 API 程序 isBadVersion(version)，但是不能频繁调用该程序，需最小化调用 API 的次数  
考虑使用二分法
```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# @param version, an integer
# @return a bool
# def isBadVersion(version):

class Solution(object):
    def firstBadVersion(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        temp_max, temp_min = n, 1
        while temp_max > temp_min:
            mid = (temp_max + temp_min)/2
            if isBadVersion(mid) == True:
                temp_max = mid ### 右边界移动到 mid 的位置，为了保证右边界仍包含错品
            if isBadVersion(mid) == False:
                temp_min = mid + 1  ### 左边界向 mid 右侧移动一步，靠近错品，缩小范围
        return temp_min
```
