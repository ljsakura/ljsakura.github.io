Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3. 
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```
当可以进行多次买入卖出时，即是对局部最大差值进行求和  
一开始思路陷入了死胡同，如何筛选出局部最大差值，后来参考了下其他人的solution，发现只要对array进行后位减前位的操作，并筛出大于0的加和即可
solution 1

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :typeprices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not prices:
            return 0
        result = 0
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i] - prices[i-1] > 0:
                result += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        return result
```
第二种解法就是生成一个新的array index ，用prices[0] 和prices[:-1] 拼接而成，用prices 和index 做减法，并筛选出大于0的进行求和，与solution 1 大同小异

solution 2

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :typeprices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not prices:
            return 0
        result = 0
        index = [prices[0]] + prices[:-1]
        for i in range(0,len(prices)):
            if prices[i] - index[i] > 0:
                result += prices[i] - index[i]
        return result
```
