You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```
给定一组序列，代表该镇上每户人家的钱财数，求窃贼能获取的最大金额，前提是不能偷相邻两家的，否则会报警，招来警察蜀黍

老公说，所有求最大值的问题都是耍流氓，啊不，是动态规划
```python
solution 1

class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, nums):
        """
        :typenums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums)==0:
            return0
        if len(nums)<3:
            return max(nums)
        if len(nums)==3:
            return max(nums[0]+nums[2] , nums[1])
        return max(nums[-1]+self.rob(nums[:-2]) , self.rob(nums[:-1]))
```
but这个solution的效率在遇上多维数组的时候就自动死翘翘了，参考了别人的问题，有点像之前求股市的那个问题一样，跳跃求和，然后保留极大值，直接转了coder_orz博客上的一个solution

solution 2
```python
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, nums):
        """
        :typenums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        now = last = 0
        for i in nums:
            last, now = now, max(i+last, now)
        return now
