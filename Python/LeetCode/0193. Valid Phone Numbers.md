Given a text file file.txt that contains list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

For example, assume that file.txt has the following content:
```
987-123-4567 
123 456 7890 
(123) 456-7890
```
Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:
```
987-123-4567 
(123) 456-7890
```

这道题涉及到正则表达式，因为之前对正则表达式没有过多接触，特地去网上找了些资料，https://wizardforcel.gitbooks.io/py-re-guide/content/3.html 该链接为正则表达式指南，对正则表达式的含义及应用做了详尽的描述
```python
# Read from the file file.txt and output all valid phone numbers to stdout.
sed -nr '/^(\([0-9]{3}\) ){1}[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$|^([0-9]{3}-){2}[0-9]{4}$/p' file.txt
