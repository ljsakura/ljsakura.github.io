Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
```
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.
```
Example 2:
```
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return false.
```
Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

判断字符串 s 是否是 t 的子序列  
所谓子序列即 t 删除掉部分字符后即可变为 s，也就是说 s 在不改变字符顺序的情况下，在两两之间添加或不添加字符就可以转变为 t  
按序查找 s 中的每一个字符是否在 t 中，当存在时则截取 t 当前位置之后的字符串作为新的 t，然后继续查找 s 的下一个字符
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isSubsequence(self, s, t):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not s:
            return True
        for x in s:
            if x not in t:
                return False
            else:
                t = t[t.index(x)+1:]
        return True
```
