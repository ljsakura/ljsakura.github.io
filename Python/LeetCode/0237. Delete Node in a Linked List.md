Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:


Example 1:
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
``` 
Note:

The linked list will have at least two elements.  
All of the nodes' values will be unique.  
The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.  
Do not return anything from your function.  
给定一个数值，删除单链表上等于该值的节点  
链表至少包含两个元素，且每个值都是唯一的，给定值不会是尾节点  
有鉴于本题只给了 node 这么一个参数，所以也不用考虑表头还是表尾，直接将该节点的下一个节点值赋值到当前节点上，然后删除下一节点
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = node.next.next
```
