Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
```
Example 1:

Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4] 
Output: 5  
max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price) 

Example 2:

Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1] 
Output: 0  
In this case, no transaction is done, 
i.e. max profit = 0. 
```

本题与52题很相似，同为动态规划问题  
大体思路为设定两个参数，一个为存储最终结果的极大差值参数result，一个为存储局部最小值点的参数curr，从首位开始，当出现局部最小值时，将这个值传输给curr，同时将其后的数值与curr的差值传入result，不断更新保留最大值，curr的值在变的同时，result也在变

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :typeprices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not prices:
            return 0
        result ,  curr = 0 , prices[0]
        for index in prices[1:]:
            curr = min(curr, index)
            result = max(result , index - curr)
        return result
