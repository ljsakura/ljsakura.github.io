Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
```
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:
```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
```
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:
```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```
给定一个可能包含重复数值的list，且重复数值是连续存在的，要求删除重复数值，并返回新list 的长度，并且不能提高空间复杂度，即del不能使用，如[1,1,2] 返回 [1,2]  
给定一个初始值 length，遍历 list，当发现当前数值与前一位置数值（或是length-1位置的数值）不同时，将 length 的值加1，同时将遍历至当前位置的数值赋值给 length-1 的位置上，遍历结束后将原 list 中 length 以后的数值都咔嚓掉，截取[:length]为新的list

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :typenums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums:
            return 0
        length = 1
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i-1]: # 也可以写作 if nums[i] != nums[length-1]:
                length += 1
                nums[length-1] = nums[i]
            else:
                next
        nums = nums[:length]
        return length
```
